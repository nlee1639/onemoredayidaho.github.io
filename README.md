# onemoredayidaho.github.io

## Prerequisites
* [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

## TODO:
* Check the resources folder for info about One More Day
* Add a nav bar (and maybe a footer?) to _layouts/default.html. This file will be the template for every page on your site
* Add some more pictures to the img folder
* Create a landing page in index.md. Jekyll will combine the contents of this file with the template you defined above to create your landing page at _site/index.html
* Build out about.md, maybe use some text from the resources folder
* Build out contact.md. Again, someday soon we will have real contact info for Mr. COnley, but in the meantime just make something up.
* Build out resources.md, again, fake links are fine for now. Someday this page will be full of links to resources for veterans in the Treasure Valley
* Update page styling in /css/main.css

Test your changes from the project root folder. If you are one of my Web Design & Development students, that will probably look like:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/onemoredayidaho.github.io
```
Build and serve your site with:
```bash
bundles exec jekyll serve
```
Open a web browser, and type http://localhost:4000 into the URL bar
